This dashboard aggregates country-level development data from Data Commons to show progress on the SDGs. It compares relationships across development indicators to identify the factors that are driving or slowing progress. This information is useful for understanding the development landscape in Nigeria since the adoption of the SDGs in 2015."

    description: "The life expectancy in Nigeria is at an all-time high of 52.9 years as of 2022, the highest since 1960 when the country gained independence. At independence, life expectancy was 37.4 years; by 2000, it was 47.2 years. What is driving this improvement? We see that infant mortality was steadily declining as life expectancy rose."

For other countries with large populations the rates of death were much higher. For example the United States suffered over 1 million deaths from 103 million confirmed cases. As of 2022, the COVID-19 vaccination rate in Nigeria was under 7%. Given the low vaccination rate and its poor health infrastructure, what kept the death rate so low for Nigeria and many other countries in Africa?"

What is the relationship between birth rates and education, especially for women?"

Below are some examples of these nonprofits.\n* [Helpmum](https://helpmum.org/) is a social enterprise with the mission to reduce maternal and infant mortality in Africa.\n* [Project PINK BLUE](https://projectpinkblue.org/ngoscsos-cancer-policy-advocacy-nigeria/) is an organization engaged in cancer awareness, free cancer screenings, support to people battling cancer, patient navigation, advocacy and fundraising for cancer patients, cancer research, oncology training and psychological support.\n* [Fairlife Africa](https://www.fairlifeafrica.org/) is a progressive, humanitarian organization.
