Ground water and reservoirs are driven to depletion through increased demand from a range of extractive processes including domestic and industry usage, and agricultural production.

Managing water withdrawal is an important effort to combat water scarcity in the face of accelerating climate change."

Tracking emissions and their source is an integral part to managing our environmental footprint. The phrase \"non biogenic emissions\" refers to any emissions that do not come from a natural source.
