    <h2>Why is TechSoup committed to more public data?</h2>
    <p>
      Many of the big challenges the world faces require deep insights to solve. These insights will need to be firmly grounded in data. We believe that equipping local civil society actors with access to public data will empower them to make decisions and take calculated risks in order to best serve their communities. We also know that civil society holds rich local insights, and we are committed to helping civil society organizations share their knowledge with the world in a more inclusive way. 
    </p>
