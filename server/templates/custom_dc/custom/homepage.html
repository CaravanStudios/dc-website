    <h1>Public data that can power your work</h1>
    <p>
      Data Commons is a powerful tool that nonprofits and other organizations can use to find public data all in one place. [TO DO] Whether you’re trying to make a data-informed decision or understand your community better, you can find data that matters to you. 
    </p>
    <h3>Tailor made for nonprofit organizations</h3>
    <p>
      TechSoup and DataCommons.org are collaborating to understand which datasets are useful to nonprofits and how they might more easily access them. TechSoup.datacommons.org and DataCommons.org hold the same datasets, but TechSoup.datacommons.org will include resources tailored to nonprofits as well as additional data that organizations identify and request. If you have datasets in mind that aren’t part of Data Commons, or you have a need that you wish you could meet using Data Commons, please take a moment to share your ideas. TechSoup.datacommons.org is informed by what you need to know, and will change based on your input.
